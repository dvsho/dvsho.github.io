What type of food do you cook?
Nothing is off the table.

What is your favorite dish to cook?
It's really hard to choose, but I've made steak the most.

How do you find new recipes?
Mostly from YouTube. I recommend Joshua Weissman and Preppy Kitchen.

Is cooking hard?
It can seem intimidating at first but you definitely learn as you go. Each time I fail - and I've failed many times - I learn something valuable. So don't be afraid of making mistakes and trying again.

Got any tips?
1.  Always add 2 to 3 times more garlic than what the recipe calls for.
2. Use grams instead of cups.
3. I think ribeye cap is by far the best cut of steak there is. It's the most tender part of the ribeye. You can find it at Costco.
